## fantastic-barnacle

simple services for deployment exercises: implementing a coupon managing service
 (generate, issue, expire, etc)

# TODO
- design a high level architecture
  - define actors, entities, relations
  - define service level objectives
  - prototype and review the service
    - how to handle the concurrency, given that the number of coupons are limited?

# DONE
